# GasFreshdesk - OO Class for Freshdesk API(v2)
GasFreshdesk is a simple Freshdesk API Class for GAS(Google Apps Script)

Github: https://github.com/zixia/gas-freshdesk

## Why GasFreshdesk?

I made a number of freshdesk API calls in GAS in order to convert emails from my Gmail account to tickets in my daily life. Most of the emails are business plans with attachments.

I found Freshdesk API very hard to use and debug in GAS, especialy with attachments. Writing more code became more complicated. So I decided to modulize it to GasFreshdesk module.

### What does GasFreshdesk look like?

GasFreshdesk is very clean and easy to use.

```javascript
var MyFreshdesk = new Freshdesk('https://mikebo.freshdesk.com', 'Jrg0FQNzX3tzuHbiFjYQ')

var ticket = new MyFreshdesk.Ticket({
  description:'A description'
  , subject: 'A subject'
  , email: 'you@example.com'
})

ticket.assign(9000658396)
ticket.note({
  body: 'Hi tom, Still Angry'
  , private: true
})
ticket.reply({
  body: 'Hi tom, Still Angry'
  , cc_emails: 'you@example.com' 
})
ticket.setPriority(2)
ticket.setStatus(2)

ticket.del()
ticket.restore()

Logger.log('ticket #' + ticket.getId() + ' was set!')
```

It's very clean and easy to use, huh ;-)

### How to enable GasFreshdesk library in GAS?

To use GasFreshdesk in your GAS script editor, just add the follow lines, then you are set.

```javascript
if ((typeof Freshdesk)==='undefined') { // GasFreshdesk Initialization. (only if not initialized yet.)
  eval(UrlFetchApp.fetch('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zixia/gas-freshdesk/master/src/gas-freshdesk-lib.js').getContentText())
} // Class Freshdesk is ready for use now!

```

More sample code could be found in the test files if you like to look into it. 

GasFreshdesk test suite: https://github.com/zixia/gas-freshdesk/blob/master/src/gas-freshdesk-tests.js

### How to run tests?

You must run tests inside google apps script editor. Open google script editor, copy/paste gas-freshdesk-tests.js into it, then click Run.

There's also an easier way to do it, you could go to my develop environment(read only) to run and clone. Follow this link: https://script.google.com/a/zixia.net/macros/d/Mta4oea1VMIugfSGRo4QrAnKRT9d30hqB/edit?uiv=2&mid=ACjPJvGt4gnXjJwXnToB0jIMEbSvqKUF6vH-uq-m59SqnjXqTQ03NDn_khlNE6ha_mPnrOAYEnyFk80nHYmt_hppO3AgDkO_vVLrYJXzcPPagwRromd0znfLreNFAu4p0rYTC-Jlo-sAKOM, then click `gas-freshdesk-test.gs` in file browser on the left.
