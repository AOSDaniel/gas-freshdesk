# GasFreshdesk - OO Class for Freshdesk API
GasFreshdesk is a easy to use Freshdesk API Class for GAS(Google Apps Script)

Github: https://github.com/zixia/gas-freshdesk

## Why GasFreshdesk?

I made lots of freshdesk api calls in gas in order to transfer emails in my gmail to tickets in my daily life. Most of them is bizplan with attachments.

I found Freshdesk API is very hard to use and debug in gas, especialy with attachments. Wrote more code is like a total mess. So I decided to modulize it to GasFreshdesk module.

### What is GasFreshdesk looks like?

GasFreshdesk is very clean and easy to use.

```javascript
var MyFreshdesk = new Freshdesk('https://mikebo.freshdesk.com', 'Jrg0FQNzX3tzuHbiFjYQ')

var ticket = new MyFreshdesk.Ticket({
  helpdesk_ticket: {
    description:'A description'
    , subject: 'A subject'
    , email: 'you@example.com'
  }
})

ticket.assign(9000658396)
ticket.addNote({
  body: 'Hi tom, Still Angry'
  , private: true
})
ticket.setPriority(2)
ticket.setStatus(2)

ticket.del()
ticket.restore()

Logger.log('ticket #' + ticket.getId() + ' was set!')
```

It's so clean and easy to use, ah? :]

### How to enable GasFreshdesk library in GAS?

To use GasFreshdesk in your GAS script editor, just add the follow lines, then you are set.
